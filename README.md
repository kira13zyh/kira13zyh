I am a frontend software engineer who builds data-rich web apps using React and Typescript! Some fun things I have worked on in the past: I have helped people build iOS + Android compatible apps in React Native, migrate their blogs from Tumblr to Github Pages, and build blogs in Next.js! I love researching skincare products, making chain jewelry, and cooking yummy plant-based foods.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a functional skincare visualization tool!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to work with clay
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an ARKit project
